mindi 0.5

- Repackaged and released as gem.

mindi 0.4

- The internal names for instance variables used to store values associated
  with services are now more obscure. Thanks to Greg Fodor for the suggestion.

mindi 0.3

- Allow +nil+ and +false+ as service values. This allows limited rake-like functionality--see examples/rake-alike.rb.

- Can now include MinDI::BasicContainer instead of extend MinDI::Container, for convenience.

- Lots of examples.

mindi 0.2

- Injectable containers. See examples/inject.rb. Note that including the MinDI::Injectable module not only provides this new functionality but also extends with MinDI::Container

- Because of the above change, including MinDI::Injectable is now the recommended way of using MinDI.

mindi 0.1

- first release
